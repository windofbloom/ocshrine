        <div class="question">
            <button>
                <span>What do they do when they're away from each other?</span>
            </button>
            <p>Hao and Tsukiko have a tendency to keep an eye on each other. Specially Hao since Tsukiko has a special ability to get into troubles easily (even when she tries so hard to avoid it); once they locate each other position they patiently wait a little before reaching for one another.</p>

            <p>Both. They have a tendency to engage in stupid, non-serious, competitions between; always trying to catch up with the other. It's their way to have fun.</p>

            <button>

            <p>They could have had a different life. No Shaman King, no reincarnation cycles. Just them, freely wandering the world, maybe having a family; that was the idea. Sadly, Tsukiko dies before it could happen.</p>
